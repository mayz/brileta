# Brileta

Brileta is an experimental game engine and sandbox. The goal is to build interesting systems - environmental, social, tactical - and see what emerges from their interactions.

This is a personal hobby project. It's a playground for ideas, not a product. There's no release timeline, no roadmap promises, and no guarantee that anything works.

The project prioritizes:
- **Mechanical experimentation** over genre purity
- **Feel and atmosphere** over feature completeness
- **Emergent gameplay** from systemic interactions

## Inspirations

**Tone & Setting:**
- *Fallout 1* and *Fallout 2*
- Late 90s isometric RPGs
- *Disco Elysium*

**Mechanics:**
- Jason Tocci's TTRPG *Wastoid*
- *Brogue*

## Design Principles

**Systemic over scripted:** Prefer mechanics that emerge from system interactions over hand-authored special cases.

**Feel first:** Visual and audio feedback matter as much as mechanical correctness. Uncertain outcomes deserve dramatic presentation.

**Depth through interaction:** Interesting gameplay comes from systems interacting, not from adding more systems in isolation.

**Input Philosophy:** The game should be fully playable with mouse-only. Keyboard shortcuts exist for convenience and speed but are never required. Keyboard-only play is not a design goal.

## Getting Started

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
2. Run `uv sync`.
